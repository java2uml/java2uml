			How do I use this program?</h1>
			
			<hr/>
			<p>This program uses PlantUML language to create UML diagrams right from your java source code (only Java 7 and below is supported now). Output is PlantUML code, which can be interpreted by PlantUML software or plugins for different IDE's. Check out the <a href="http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/running.html">PlantUML web-site</a> to get more information. <b>If you do not want to do anything further</b>, our program and installed Graphviz software, are <b>the only</b> things that you need, to see diagrams of your Java project. If your java source code is too big and your computer is slow, we're recommending to you to turn off the option "Show diagram", and generate only PlantUML code. After that you could click the button "Generate via web". This will generate a diagram using PlantUML server and will open it on the PlantUML website. Below you will find instructions on how to create a chart using only this program.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p>First of all, if you want to see image of diagram in "Diagram" tab, you should install Graphviz software. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz web-site</a>. Installation process for different operating systems may vary. </p></li>
			<li><p>
				Then you should choose directory of your Java project, or jar archive, by clicking the button "Select files".
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Then, optionally, set preferred parameters of the future diagram. Such as: direction of diagram, shown relationships, type of files to be parsed, and preferred diagram type. Some of the parameters that you see may be unavailable for use. It simply means that we didn’t implement that functionality yet. Watch out for changes.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Press "Generate" button. 
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				If all previous steps had been done correctly, you will see PlantUML code in "PlantUML code" tab, and in the ”Diagram" tab, you'll see UML diagram that represents
				your project.
			</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>
If Graphviz was not installed correctly on your system, and you're trying to generate a class diagram, you will see an error message generated by PlantUML in the "Diagram" tab.</b></p>
