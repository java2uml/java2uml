					The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering, which is designed to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

			<p>UML is standard notation for software design. UML is used to design applications of varying complexity. Thanks to UML you can look at your applications from different points of view, and better understand them. UML can be used not only at the application design stage, but also for better understanding of existing applications. With our program you can see what's really going on inside your Java project. If you're stuck and you need a broader understanding of the interaction of objects within your Java application - you’ll need a UML diagram. By a happy coincidence our program is able to generate them directly from your code.</p>
<p>Our program generates two types of diagrams - class diagrams and sequence diagrams (for now, only classes diagrams). For a better understanding of what it is, please refer to Wikipedia or thematic literature. Many articles describing the purpose of these diagrams may be found on the internet.</p>
